# regulators_integrating_RNAseq_ChIPseq
This approach assumes that lineage regulators tend to show consistent changes in both RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, e.g., increase in expression, increase in H3K4me3 and/or decreases in H3K27me3, while structural/non-regulatory genes tend to show very significant changes only in RNA-seq.
